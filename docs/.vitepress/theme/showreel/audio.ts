// The reel's soundtrack, synthesized with the Web Audio API: oscillators,
// seeded noise, filters, and envelopes, with no samples and no network. The
// whole score is written in reel seconds and scheduled from any start point,
// so playback, seeking, and offline export hear the same mix.
//
// Sound design leads: every choreographed accent in the scenes has its own
// sound, tuned to D major where it has a pitch. Music supports it: a build
// under the fold, a minimal groove with sub bass that ducks under the
// effects, a breakdown under the morph that drops back and rises into a
// sixteenth of silence, and the resolve on the end card.
//
// This file is the master chain and the scheduling. The score itself is in
// score/: one module per section (score/index.ts), the sound palette they
// share (score/sounds.ts), and the voices and curves under them
// (score/mix.ts).
