The MIT license is retained in LICENSE and the repository NOTICE. This private
module ships inside mbx, including crates.io packages; it is not a registry dependency.

Local integration changes: lib.rs becomes mod.rs; ratatui conversions are always
enabled, optional gradient code stays disabled, crossterm uses ratatui's re-export,
and unused upstream APIs are allowed. Upstream examples are ignored because this
is a private module, while upstream unit tests remain enabled. Rustfmt normalizes
formatting. No rendering behavior changes are intended.
