//! The file-digest ledger a checkout carries from one session to the next.
//!
//! Within a session the cache agent remembers the digest of every file a shim
//! hashed, keyed by the file's identity (length, modification time, and change
//! time), so a dependency rlib is read once however many crates link it. The
//! agent exits with the build, and without this file the next session would
//! start from nothing: the crate being edited would read every one of its
//! unchanged dependencies again before it could look anything up, a gigabyte
//! of rlibs for a large binary. Persisting the ledger beside the checkout's
//! other private state makes that first lookup as cheap as the second.
//!
//! Every entry is still checked against the disk before it answers, so a
//! stale file here costs one hash and nothing else; the ledger is a shortcut,
//! never a dependency, and every failure in this module degrades to an empty
//! one.
