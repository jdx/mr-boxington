//! Where a recorded build's compiler time went, ranked by the cause behind it.
//!
//! `mbx explain --last` walks a build's misses one crate at a time. This reads
//! the same recordings and ranks them by cost instead: every uncached
//! compilation is given one cause, and the causes are listed largest first with
//! what would remove them.
//!
//! A crate whose own key material did not change missed because an artifact it
//! consumes did. Its time is charged to the crate where that change started,
//! followed through as many dependency levels as the recordings show, because
//! that crate is the one a reader can do something about. An edit to a crate
//! with many dependents therefore reads as one large cause, which is what it
//! cost, rather than as many small misses.
//!
//! Compiler time says what a build spent, not what it waited for, because
//! compilations overlap. The [`critical_path`] section answers the second
//! question from the recorded start, end, and dependencies of each unit.
