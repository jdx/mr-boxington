//! Deferred remote publication for a build session.
//!
//! Publishing a compilation result is not on the critical path of the build that
//! produced it: the local CAS already holds every object before the shim is told
//! the result was stored. Uploading inside that request would make every miss
//! wait for a round trip that only later builds benefit from, and Cargo cannot
//! schedule a dependent crate until the wrapper it is waiting on exits.
//!
//! This module accepts uploads into a queue instead, hands each caller a ticket
//! it can await, and drains the queue before the session exits. The queue also
//! gives the client one place where several pending blobs are visible at once,
//! which is what lets them be coalesced into a single request.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! A remote action result may only be published once every blob it references is
//! visible remotely; a server validates the output tree before committing one.
//! Deferring uploads removes the transport ordering that used to guarantee that,
//! so an action result carries the tickets of the blobs enqueued before it and
//! waits for them itself.
